# CSE241-OOP-Assignments
All the assignments of the object oriented programming course by Yusuf Sinan Akgul (Fall 2020)

All the assignments are related to the Hex-Game. New features are implemented for each project.

I am also working on implementing GUI with Java Swing. Planning to add a file about it in the upcoming weeks.
You can also play the original game via this link: http://www.lutanho.net/play/hex.html
